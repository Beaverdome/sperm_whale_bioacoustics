<p>This repository builds on the work in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48909-4">Deep Machine Learning Techniques for the Detection and Classification of Sperm Whale Bioacoustics</a>, a fascinating paper by Peter C. Bermant, Michael M. Bronstein, Robert J. Wood, Shane Gero &amp; David F. Gruber.</p>
<p>The purpose of the repository is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>reproduce the RNN experiments, providing executable code with accompanying explanation to allow others to leverage these novel techniques on their data</li>
<li>identify whether architectural changes and advanced training schedules (1cycle policy) could alleviate the need for the cumbersome pretraining step</li>
<li>experiment with and report results of using Random Forest instead of the RNN, a model that can be trained to good effects without specialized deep learning knowledge, is not prone to overfitting, that can be trained without the need of a GPU and that lends itself very well to interpetation</li>
</ul>
<p>Above all, the goal of the repository is to provide an introduction to the world of marine biology and modern machine learning techniques.</p>
